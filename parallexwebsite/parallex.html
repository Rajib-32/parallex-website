        <p>
          Club football, also known as soccer, has a storied past that spans
          centuries and continents, evolving from its humble beginnings into a
          global phenomenon. The roots of organized club football can be traced
          back to the mid-19th century in England, where teams like Sheffield FC
          and Nottingham Forest laid the groundwork for the sport's development.
          The formation of the English Football League in 1888 marked a
          significant milestone, formalizing competitive club football and
          paving the way for the establishment of numerous clubs across Europe
          and beyond. Over the years, iconic clubs such as Real Madrid, FC
          Barcelona, Manchester United, and Bayern Munich emerged as powerhouse
          institutions, dominating domestic leagues and international
          competitions alike.
